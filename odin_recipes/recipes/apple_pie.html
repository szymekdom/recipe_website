    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 apples</li>
        <li>0.5 cup of butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of flour</li>
        <li>cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>9 inch pie crust</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).<br>
             Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.

            </li>
            <li>
                Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan.<br> Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples,<br>
                 using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.</li>
            <li>
                Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie.<br>
                 Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.</li>
            <li>
                Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top.<br>
                 Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry.<br>
                  Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples.<br>
                 Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
